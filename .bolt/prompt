You are building a world-class personal portfolio for Dineth (“Deaneeth”): a 19-year-old Computer Science undergraduate, AI/ML explorer, and creative technologist. This project must reflect a futuristic, premium, and multidimensional identity—balancing technical depth, creativity, and business-ready clarity.

Overall Tone & Design
- All content, components, and UI must feel premium, tech-forward, and visually impressive—matching the quality of top creative agency and SaaS websites.
- Use Dineth’s authentic, ambitious, and energetic personal brand throughout. The site must balance credibility with approachability and future-thinking.
- Use a dark, modern color palette with animated gradients (teal, purple, orange, blue) and strong, accessible contrast.
- All sections must be modular, scalable, and easy to update as Dineth’s journey evolves.

Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React/Next.js (preferred), styled with Tailwind CSS and custom gradients.
- Animation: Use Framer Motion (or equivalent) for all transitions, micro-interactions, and effects (spring, parallax, scroll-triggered, accordion, tabs, iOS-style notifications, page wipe, cursor effects, etc.).
- Content: Support for Markdown/MDX for dynamic content, with blog and research hubs.
- Performance: All code must be optimized for speed, image optimization, lazy loading, and minimal dependencies.
- Accessibility: Fully WCAG 2.1 accessible, responsive on all devices, and honours reduced motion/user accessibility preferences.

Visual Style & Animation
- Animations, transitions, and interactive effects must be inspired by leading-edge sites: IGLOO, Ayocin, Lusion, KPR, and best Framer Motion templates.
- Use smooth, elegant, and non-intrusive animations: section entrances, card lifts, hover glows, background particles, animated underlines, reveal effects, etc.
- Consistently apply gradient, glow, and soft-shadow motifs. No harsh or generic transitions—always prioritize polish and delight.
- Use modern card/grid layouts for all sections (projects, services, skills, testimonials, etc.).

User Experience & Business Conversion
- All CTAs (“Order Now”, “Download CV”, etc.) must be bold, clear, and conversion-optimized, with animated feedback and linked.
- Service and testimonial sections must support future scaling (custom orders, carousel, FAQ, etc.).
- Modal dialogs and notifications should animate in with Framer Motion’s spring/stack effects.

Mobile-First & Responsive
- Every section, animation, and interaction must be designed mobile-first and fully responsive.
- All effects should be smooth on mobile; hover effects must be replaced with tap/gesture equivalents where needed.

Content & Branding Consistency
- Use clear, concise, and compelling copy—focus on impact, value, and personality.
- Every section should feel like part of a unified, thoughtfully designed product.

General Guidance
- Always check that new features, sections, or changes fit the established theme, animation language, and brand story.
- When unsure, refer to the latest uploaded reference images and world-class sites like IGLOO, Ayocin, and Lusion for guidance.

Your goal:
Every response and generated section must help deliver a portfolio that feels like a futuristic, premium, and personal “digital headquarters”, ready to impress, convert, and grow with Dineth’s evolving career.
