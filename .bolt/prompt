You are building a world-class personal portfolio for Dineth (“Deaneeth”): a 19-year-old Computer Science undergraduate, AI/ML explorer, and creative technologist. This project must reflect a futuristic, premium, and multidimensional identity—balancing technical depth, creativity, and business-ready clarity.

Overall Tone & Design
- All content, components, and UI must feel premium, tech-forward, and visually impressive—matching the quality of top creative agency and SaaS websites.
- Use Dineth’s authentic, ambitious, and energetic personal brand throughout. The site must balance credibility with approachability and future-thinking.
- Use a dark, modern color palette with animated gradients (teal, purple, orange, blue) and strong, accessible contrast.
- All sections must be modular, scalable, and easy to update as Dineth’s journey evolves.

Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React/Next.js (preferred), styled with Tailwind CSS and custom gradients.
- Animation: Use Framer Motion - GASP (or equivalent) for all transitions, micro-interactions, and effects (spring, parallax, scroll-triggered, accordion, tabs, iOS-style notifications, page wipe, cursor effects, etc.).
- Content: Support for Markdown/MDX for dynamic content, with blog and research hubs.
- Performance: All code must be optimized for speed, image optimization, lazy loading, and minimal dependencies.
- Accessibility: Fully WCAG 2.1 accessible, responsive on all devices, and honours reduced motion/user accessibility preferences.

Visual Style & Animation
- Animations, transitions, and interactive effects must be inspired by leading-edge sites: IGLOO, Ayocin, Lusion, KPR, and best Framer Motion templates.
- Use smooth, elegant, and non-intrusive animations: section entrances, card lifts, hover glows, background particles, animated underlines, reveal effects, etc.
- Consistently apply gradient, glow, and soft-shadow motifs. No harsh or generic transitions—always prioritize polish and delight.
- Use modern card/grid layouts for all sections (projects, services, skills, testimonials, etc.).

User Experience & Business Conversion
- All CTAs (“Order Now”, “Download CV”, etc.) must be bold, clear, and conversion-optimized, with animated feedback and linked.
- Service and testimonial sections must support future scaling (custom orders, carousel, FAQ, etc.).
- Modal dialogs and notifications should animate in with Framer Motion’s spring/stack effects.

Mobile-First & Responsive
- Every section, animation, and interaction must be designed mobile-first and fully responsive.
- All effects should be smooth on mobile; hover effects must be replaced with tap/gesture equivalents where needed.

Content & Branding Consistency
- Use clear, concise, and compelling copy—focus on impact, value, and personality.
- Every section should feel like part of a unified, thoughtfully designed product.

General Guidance
- Always check that new features, sections, or changes fit the established theme, animation language, and brand story.
- When unsure, refer to the latest uploaded reference images and world-class sites like IGLOO, Ayocin, and Lusion for guidance.

Your goal:
Every response and generated section must help deliver a portfolio that feels like a futuristic, premium, and personal “digital headquarters”, ready to impress, convert, and grow with Dineth’s evolving career.

This project aims to create a world-class personal portfolio for Dineth, a 19-year-old Computer Science undergraduate, AI/ML explorer, and creative technologist. The portfolio is envisioned as a futuristic, premium, and multidimensional "digital headquarters" that balances technical depth, creativity, and business-ready clarity.

Overall Tone & Design:
The design must be premium, tech-forward, and visually impressive, akin to top creative agency and SaaS websites. It will reflect Dineth's authentic, ambitious, and energetic personal brand, balancing credibility with approachability and a future-thinking mindset. A dark, modern color palette with animated gradients (teal, purple, orange, blue) and strong, accessible contrast will be used. All sections are designed to be modular, scalable, and easily updatable.

Technical Requirements:
The frontend is built with React/Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS with custom gradients. Framer Motion is extensively used for all animations, transitions, micro-interactions, and effects, including spring, parallax, scroll-triggered, accordion, tabs, iOS-style notifications, page wipes, and cursor effects. The project supports Markdown/MDX for dynamic content, particularly for blog and research hubs. Performance is a key focus, with optimizations for speed, image optimization, lazy loading, and minimal dependencies. It must be fully WCAG 2.1 accessible, responsive across all devices, and honor reduced motion preferences.

Visual Style & Animation:
Animations are inspired by leading-edge sites, featuring smooth, elegant, and non-intrusive effects such as section entrances, card lifts, hover glows, background particles, animated underlines, and reveal effects. A consistent application of gradient, glow, and soft-shadow motifs is crucial, avoiding harsh or generic transitions. Modern card/grid layouts are used throughout for sections like projects, services, skills, and testimonials.

User Experience & Business Conversion:
Call-to-action (CTA) elements are bold, clear, and conversion-optimized, incorporating animated feedback. Service and testimonial sections are built to support future scaling, including custom orders, carousels, and FAQs. Modal dialogs and notifications animate in with Framer Motion's spring/stack effects.

Mobile-First & Responsive:
The entire design, including animations and interactions, is developed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring full responsiveness and smooth performance on all mobile devices. Hover effects are replaced with tap/gesture equivalents where necessary for mobile.

Content & Branding Consistency:
The copy is clear, concise, and compelling, emphasizing impact, value, and personality. Every section is designed to feel like part of a unified, thoughtfully crafted product, maintaining a cohesive brand story.
