## üè¢ When You Get Your Business Email

Once you purchase a custom domain and set up a business email (e.g., `contact@yourdomain.com`), you'll need to make **2 simple updates**:

### Update 1: Verify Your Domain with Resend

**Why?** To send emails from your own domain instead of `onboarding@resend.dev`

**Steps**:
1. Log in to Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/domains
2. Click **"Add Domain"** and enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Add the provided DNS records to your domain provider:
   - **SPF Record** (TXT)
   - **DKIM Record** (TXT)
   - **DMARC Record** (TXT)
4. Wait 24-48 hours for verification

**Where to add DNS records** (common providers):
- **Namecheap**: Domain List ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Advanced DNS ‚Üí Add Record
- **GoDaddy**: DNS Management ‚Üí Add Record
- **Cloudflare**: DNS ‚Üí Records ‚Üí Add Record
- **Google Domains**: DNS ‚Üí Custom Records ‚Üí Manage

### Update 2: Change 2 Lines of Code

**File**: `app/api/contact/route.ts`

**Line ~75** - Update the "from" email:

```typescript
// BEFORE (current - using Resend's free email):
from: 'Portfolio Contact Form <onboarding@resend.dev>',

// AFTER (your custom domain):
from: 'Portfolio Contact Form <noreply@yourdomain.com>',
```

**Examples**:
```typescript
// Option 1: No-reply address (recommended)
from: 'Dineth Portfolio <noreply@yourdomain.com>',

// Option 2: Contact address
from: 'Dineth Nethusahan <contact@yourdomain.com>',

// Option 3: Info address
from: 'Portfolio Contact <info@yourdomain.com>',
```

**File**: `.env.local` (or production environment variables)

Update where you receive emails:
```env
# BEFORE (current):
CONTACT_EMAIL=dinethnethusahan@gmail.com

# AFTER (your business email):
CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@yourdomain.com
```
